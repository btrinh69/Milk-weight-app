# Milk-weight-app

The <a href="https://www.wisconsincheese.com/wi-cheese-companies/27/chalet-cheese-cooperative">Chalet Cheese factory</a> sells a variety of different cheeses. This project aims to create an interactive data visualizer program with a graphic user interface (GUI) to help a local farm analyze and report on the milk that has been sold to them by their farmers.

This program uses Java, JavaFx, and JUnit.

The main functions of the program:
1. Add data:
- Add single data (data for a day)
- Add data from a file (data for a month)
2. Adjust data:
- Choose a data range to display the data and adjust the data directly on an interactive table
3. Report:
- Farm Report: display the monthly total milk weight, monthly average milk weight, and the share (percentage) of the milk weight bought from that farm for a given year
- Annual Report: display total milk weight, average monthly milk weight, and the total share of farms for a given year
- Monthly Report: display the total, average, and share of farms for a given month
- Date Range report: display the total and share of farms in the given date range
- Export: write any of the above report to an output csv file
